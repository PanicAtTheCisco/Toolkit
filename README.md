# Welcome to my Cybersecurity Toolkit!

* This is a repository of Cybersecurity tools and resources that I think are useful.
* Many of these are I believe taken from the Parrot OS default bookmarks. Some I have added myself.
* I won't be adding descriptions to everything as I don't feel like curating that. I will for some specific stuff though.
